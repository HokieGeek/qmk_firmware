# Ansibles: Earth and Belt (Nyquist rev. 2)

This is my second Nyquist which I use for my non-work computer.

For this build I added some contacts on the side so that when it's sitting
on my laptop, I don't need the cable.

## Features
### Accents
Using keycodes defined in my [userspace files](../../../../users/hokiegeek/readme.md#accents).

Each symbol is set as part of the lower layer for the respective ANSI character.

### TMUX
Using keycodes defined in my [userspace files](../../../../users/hokiegeek/readme.md#tmux).

Mapped them to two keys accessible with my right thumb.

### Swap Hands
Enabled and used as defined in my [userspace files](../../../../users/hokiegeek/readme.md#swap-hands).

### Lights
Have added backlight LEDS as well as RGB underglow and RGB indicator LEDs for CAPS LOCK and layer selection

### Encoder
I replaced the top right key with a rotary encoder.

The function of the encoder changes depending on the selected layers. The function is
activated by twisting the knob as well as clicking the encoder once.

In addition, the function for a given layer is dependent on another
setting which can be changed by double-tapping the encoder button.

| Layers | Function | Twist action | Click action |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| \_QWERTY<br>\_COLEMAK | Volume | Increase / Decrease volume | Toggle mute |
| | Vert / Horiz Scrolling | Scroll up/down or left/right | Toggle vert / horiz |
| \_LOWER | Monitor Brightness | Increase / Decrease brightness | |
| | Monitor Warmth | Increase / Decrease warmth | |
| \_CONTROL | Kbd Backlight | Increase / Decrease brightness | Toggle backlight |
| | Kbd Underglow | | Toggle underglow |
